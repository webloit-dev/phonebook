//Kickstarting this project is very much easy and simple

1. Run the sql file/dump manually located in the 'engine' directory.

2. Change the database settings in the 'settings.json' file in the 'engine' directory. It is explanatory already.

3. Run composer to install/update the dependencies.

4. You're good to go. That's all.
